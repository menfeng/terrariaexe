The files in this folder are place holder schematics for tiles that have not been added to the painting menus yet, unlike the other schematics in this pack which are all sprites.

The walls are provided in both the World Generated and Player Generated forms (where applicable), even though TEdit already contains the world generated forms for all but a few.
Natural wall types are not usable for creating houses, while player placed wall types are. Natural walls are also harder to remove, requiring you to begin at an edge, while player placed walls can be removed from any point.

Webs will automatically load the correct sprite for their location, like any other block, and as such only need a single file for all forms.
