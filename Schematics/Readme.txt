Items placed in impossible locations with revert to their pick-up form when the map is loaded (ie trees flying in the air convert to wood).
Large items, such as tables and beds, will revert to their pickup form when the map is loaded if a piece of their structure is missing/out of place (eg a table has 6 squares. If you only have 5 or fewer squares through accidental erasure or placing tiles over the top, when you load the map the table with be in position in pickup form).

Mushrooms and Jungle plants will not grow in pots. If you attempt to place them in pots, the game reads it as an impossible locations and behaves accordingly.
Corals all require the squares directly left, right, and above to be absent on the tile layer (walls and fluids are okay, but nothing else). If there is anything in those squares other than walls or fluids, the game reads it as an impossible locations and behaves accordingly.

Vegetation is arranged by biome, Grass refers to the "forest" and "floating island" biomes. 
The Schematics for Trees growing in grass is identical to that for trees growing in corruption and jungle, so these files are interchangable. However, mushroom trees require the correct files for their biome.
Further notes can be found in the vegetation folder.

Smashable Pots are created by combining 4 corner pieces with 3 variations to each. The "Smashable Pots" folder contains an Excel Spread sheet (.exl and .exls formats) with a graphical representation of each of the 69 different possible pots. The Row number corresponds to the Schematic File number in that folder.
The folder "Sub Assembly" contains all 12 different pieces of pot, as well. Letter corresponds to Corner, reading Left to Right, and Number corresponds to Variation based on width (higher number indicates a wider pot piece, ie all 1's creates narrowest pot and all 3's creates widest pot)

Grasses and Vines are absent in this Schematics Pack, and will not likely be included in any later releases. The Natures Gift rose is marked as Immature A because that is the corresponding Rose/Flower graphic it has, no other forms of the Natures Gift rose have been observed.

Mana and Healing potions work to create Alchemy Stations just like normal bottles do. All three bottles can be found in the Crafting subfolder of the Furniture folder.

All items are provided without a wall behind them, or any liquids. Keep this in mind when building structures and the like (ie place wall after placing these schematics; lava on Fireblossoms to make them bloom, etc)
